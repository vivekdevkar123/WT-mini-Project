            </div>
            <br>


            <br>
            <br>
            <div>
                Remember back when you were a kid? You would just do things. You never thought to yourself, “What are
                the relative merits of learning baseball versus football?” You just ran around the playground and played
                baseball and football. You built sand castles and played tag and asked silly questions and looked for
                bugs and dug up grass and pretended you were a sewer monster.
            </div>



            <br>
            <br>
            <div>
                And if you loved looking for bugs, you just did that. There was no second-level analysis of, “Well, is
                looking for bugs really what I should be doing with my time as a child? Nobody else wants to look for
                bugs, does that mean there’s something wrong with me? How will looking for bugs affect my future
                prospects?”
            </div>




            <br>
            <br>
            <div>
                Today, I received approximately the 11,504th email this year from a person telling me that they don’t
                know what to do with their life. And like all of the others, this person asked me if I had any ideas of
                what they could do, where they could start, where to “find their passion.”
            </div>




            <br>
            <br>
            <div>
                But more importantly, what I want to say to these people is this: that’s the whole point—”not knowing”
                is the whole fucking point. Life is all about not knowing, and then doing something anyway. All of life
                is like this. All of it. And it’s not going to get any easier just because you found out you love your
                job cleaning septic tanks, or you scored a dream gig writing indie movies.
            </div>





            <br>
            <br>
            <div>
                I call bullshit. You already found your passion, you’re just ignoring it. Seriously, you’re awake 16
                hours a day, what the fuck do you do with your time? You’re doing something, obviously. You’re talking
                about something. There’s some topic or activity or idea that dominates a significant amount of your free
                time, your conversations, your web browsing, and it dominates them without you consciously pursuing it
                or looking for it.
            </div>


            <br>
            <br>
            <div>
                It’s right there in front of you, you’re just avoiding it. For whatever reason, you’re avoiding it.
                You’re telling yourself, “Oh well, yeah, I love comic books but that doesn’t count. You can’t make money
                with comic books.”
            </div>




            <br>
            <br>
            <div>
                The problem is not a lack of passion for something. The problem is productivity. The problem is
                perception. The problem is acceptance.
            </div>





            <br>
            <br>
            <div>
                And even then, who says you need to make money doing what you love? Since when does everyone feel
                entitled to love every fucking second of their job? Really, what is so wrong with working an okay,
                normal job with some cool people you like and then pursuing your passion in your free time on the side?
                Has the world turned upside-down or is this suddenly a novel idea to people?
            </div>


            <br>
            <br>
            <div>
                Look, here’s another slap in the face for you: every job sucks sometimes. There’s no such thing as some
                passionate activity that you will never get tired of, never get stressed over, never complain about. It
                doesn’t exist. I am living my dream job (which happened by accident, by the way. I never in a million
                years planned on this happening; like a kid on a playground I just went and tried it), and I still hate
                about 30% of it. Some days more
            </div>


            <br>
            <br>
            <div>
                Again, that’s just life.
            </div>


            <br>
            <br>
            <div>
                <img src="../../Images/Screw_Finding_Your_Passion_01.jpg" alt="">
            </div>


            <br>
            <br>
            <div>
                The issue here is, once again, expectations. If you think you’re supposed to be working 70-hour work
                weeks and sleeping in your office like Steve Jobs and loving every second of it, you’ve been watching
                too many shitty movies. If you think you’re supposed to wake up every single day dancing out of your
                pajamas because you get to go to work, then you’ve been drinking the Kool-Aid. Life doesn’t work like
                that. It’s just unrealistic. There’s a thing most of us need called balance.
            </div>
           


            <br>
            <br>
            <div>
                If you have to look for what you enjoy in life, then you’re not going to enjoy anything.
            </div>


            <br>
            <br>
            <div>
                And the real truth is that you already enjoy something. You already enjoy many things. You’re just
                choosing to ignore them.
            </div>
