                    Breakthroughs, that step-change our lives for the better, invariably come from something that most
                    people couldn’t see. Our belief of how the world should exist and operate is shaped from looking
                    backwards, not forward, so it makes sense that new paradigms that change everything — face
                    resistance in our minds. Because most people don’t see them, breaking through an existing paradigm
                    needs to provide enough compelling value for users to disrupt an old paradigm. Apple’s iPhone for
                    instance, didn’t copy the market leader, Research in Motion’s Blackberry design of needing a
                    keyboard or selling to businesses who required RIM’s security. It created a digital interface when
                    that wasn’t ‘needed’ and created an entirely new platform that changed the industry as a result.
                    Along the way, the Blackberry died, unable to compete with the value for users, that was now
                    increasing exponentially on Apple’s platform.

                    Also, note that I have attempted to look at the structural change through a ‘system lens’ rather
                    than a ‘people lens’. Although any system has bad actors, the predominant force driving decisions
                    are not because of willful neglect or bad intent, but instead, to protect the status quo (and
                    monopoly) because it’s very hard to imagine what the future could look like without it.

                    2 : Interest rates were manipulated lower to increase growth — and almost every year, taken lower
                    again as predictions of growth came up short against the reality of technological progress on the
                    market. Although the chart below references the United States, this was a global phenomenon.

                <div>
                    The lower rates and additional debt created produced limited growth which is to say deflation
                    (prices going down) would have taken hold without it and made the debt un-repayable — causing a
                    larger deflationary depression than would have happened in step 1.
                </div>

                <br><br>




                <div>
                    <i>*Note* because technology is continuing to advance exponentially, it will take exponentially more
                        debt and easing to keep the existing system intact.</i>

                    Because, unmanipulated, the result of all of that free-market competition must give us more for less
                    or we wouldn’t use it. This is to say that a monetary standard like Bitcoin would ensure the
                    exponentially improving value created by a combination of technology and competition, would fall in
                    price to match the new realities of supply and demand in a digital world. That seemingly small
                    change, unnoticed by most of society, changes everything else. In time, society will realize that it
                    also allows for an expansion of the very meaning of success.

                    In the great game of business, a monopoly rarely dies overnight. They have too much market power for
                    that. What often happens is that they miss a key technological change that would have allowed them
                    to offer value differently and then set out on a series of actions to protect their existing
                    business. Because the change delivers better value to society, those actions to protect what was all
                    but guaranteed failure in the end.

                    A battle between the free market and entrepreneurs competing to create more value on one side, and
                    manipulation and power concentrated in the hands of a few — eventually leading to totalitarian
                    control on the other.
